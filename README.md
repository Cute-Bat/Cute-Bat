- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cute-Bat, from 9 to 5 I m an English teacher at a vocational college.
- 👀 I’m interested in literature, music, foreign languages, and travelling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python and some JS. And also Scottish Gaelic ;-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on easier projects for now, so I can learn and get better.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (for now!)
